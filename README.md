# Custom_PCB_Panel
Tools-KiCad
Designed a custom KiCad symbol and footprint for the DigiSpark PCB, ensuring accurate pin mappings, electrical properties, and mechanical details. The symbol was created with proper pin labeling, while the footprint included precise pad placements, silkscreen, and courtyard outlines for proper component placement and assembly. Both were saved and integrated into the schematic and layout for the DigiSpark project.
